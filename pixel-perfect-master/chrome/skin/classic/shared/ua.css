/* The following two styles are fixing issue #67
  https://github.com/firebug/pixel-perfect/issues/67
  They can both be removed as soon as the platform is fixed:
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1168113

  This gets yet more complex since there is currently no
  CSS way how to avoid fixed position:
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1230508#c26
  The only way is using 'scroll' events and update position
  of layers manually.

  The CSS is currently using position: fixed (in addition to
  the manual scroll-offset calculation). As soon as 'absolute'
  is supported again it should be removed */
